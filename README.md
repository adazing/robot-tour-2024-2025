This is my code for the robot tour 2024-2025 season!

Notes/To Do:
-  optical flow sensor adjustment after rotational adjustment (not both at the same time)
-  ex: if moving, only update rotationally. once stopped for a bit/end of action, adjust drift with optical flow sensor (and make sure moves straight)
- if drift adjustment makes motor speed already reach max then angle cant adjust lol (maybe do what u did for time)
- also fix time lol i changed :(
